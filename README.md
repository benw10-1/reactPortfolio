## Description

This is a portfolio web application built using React, Express, and Nginx. I also use the [MUI library](https://mui.com/) for some of the UI elements, but it mostly is coded by hand in React code. I render the entire layout once, and then just zoom throughout the document to avoid rerendering stuff like my resume and all of the project images. Besides the entire development ecosystem, the page acts similar to my [original portfolio](https://github.com/benw10-1/portfolio). You can use the arrow keys, scroll wheel, or provided navigators to navigate my website.

## Installation

To install this application, open `terminal` and clone the repository by running:

    git clone https://github.com/benw10-1/reactportfolio.git

## Usage

Once the application is installed, open the `terminal` in the repository directory and run: <br>
   
    npm run deploy
    npm run start

## Visit page

You can visit the deployed page [here!](https://benw.app/)
