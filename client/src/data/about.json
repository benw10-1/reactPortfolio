    "About Me": "I'm a self-taught software/web developer located in Orange County California. I got into computer programming when I was looking for a hobby during the COVID lockdown, but it has evolved to be part of my daily life. I am always curious for new ways to do things, new ideas for me to try, and more challenges to take on. During my free time outside of work, school, and excersize, you will probably find me watching a Fireship YouTube video or scrolling StackOverflow to find any questions that haven't already been answered. ",
    "JavaScript": "JavaScript is my primary language as of now due to its versitility. It can be run as part of a webpage as a script, or can be ran in a runtime like Node.js. I have with many libraries, frameworks, and APIs such as React, OpenLayers, Wikimedia, JSdom, Moment, Mongoose, Sequelize, Express, and Google Maps. In addition to this, I have strong knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals. This includes knowledge about callback functions, promises, asyncronous programming, data types, OOP, interacting with the DOM, and regular expressions. Knowledge of these concepts has allowed me to create not only this portfolio, but many other projects (displayed on my projects page!) as well. JavaScript has also allowed me to use my knowledge of algorithms to process information and visualize it. I plan to greatly expand my JavaScript projects once I gain enough capital to start scaling.",
